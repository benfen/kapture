# Coding Conventions

Kapture's currently got a bit of a Frankenstein's monster vibe to it.
There's a lot of Bash, a bit of Kotlin, and a fair amount of Python.
The only real, overarching patterns are four spaces for tabs and inline curly brackets for blocks.
In general, just try to match what the code being modified looks like and it'll be fine.
