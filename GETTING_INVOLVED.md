# This section is for newcomers to the project.

Getting involved in a new project often happens in the following order...

- Find a use case for it that is interesting to you (or your boss).
- Find a way to contribute to the project, as it is, this might be as simple as proposing a new idea, or improving documentation.
- Find a way to extend the project either by improving its test coverage, quality, reliability, performance, or modularity.
- Build your own product on top of it and become rich :).

# What are some interesting starter projects for learning how to use kapture?

- Reproduce the existing performance results on your clusters.
- Build a new performance test that is relevant to your needs.
- Look at how changing CPU, memory, and other parameters in the kustomize scripts 
increase or decrease performance.
- If your ambitous, extend the project to include a new database or data sink of some sort.
